**1. Historical Context: The Pre-Composer, Pre-PSR Era**

To understand HeEPP, we must understand the environment in which it was born.  This was a time *before*:

*   **Composer:** The PHP dependency manager, Composer, was released in 2012. Before its widespread adoption, managing external libraries was a manual and often cumbersome process.  Developers often had to download libraries directly, place them in their projects, and manually manage updates and dependencies.
*   **PSR Standards:** The PHP Framework Interop Group (PHP-FIG) began publishing PSRs (PHP Standards Recommendations) in 2009, but adoption was gradual.  PSR-4 (autoloading) wasn't finalized until 2013.  Before PSR-4, there was no standard way to autoload classes, leading to a proliferation of custom autoloaders.
*   **JavaScript Frameworks (Dominance):** While JavaScript frameworks like jQuery existed, they hadn't yet reached the level of dominance they have today.  Server-side rendering with PHP was still the primary approach for most web applications.  The rise of single-page applications (SPAs) and the "JavaScript everywhere" philosophy was still in its early stages.
*   **Mobile Web:**  The mobile web was rapidly evolving.  Responsive design was becoming increasingly important, but tools and techniques were still maturing.
*   **HTML5 and CSS3:**  HTML5 and CSS3 were gaining traction, but browser support was still inconsistent, and developers often had to deal with cross-browser compatibility issues.

This context is *crucial* for understanding HeEPP's design.  Many of its features were direct responses to the limitations and challenges of this era.

**2. Core Design Philosophy: Server-Centric Simplicity**

HeEPP's core design philosophy can be summarized as:

*   **Server-Centricity:**  The server is the primary source of truth and handles most of the application logic and rendering.  The client is a relatively thin layer responsible for displaying the HTML generated by the server. This is a direct contrast to the client-centric approach of many modern JavaScript frameworks.
*   **Simplicity and Familiarity:**  The framework is designed to be easy to learn and use, especially for developers familiar with HTML, CSS, and PHP.  It avoids unnecessary complexity and minimizes the need to learn new syntax or paradigms.
*   **"Batteries Included":**  HeEPP provides a wide range of built-in functionality, reducing the need for external libraries. This was a common approach in frameworks of that era, aiming to provide a complete solution out of the box.
*   **Convention over Configuration (to a degree):** While HeEPP doesn't enforce strict conventions in the same way as, say, Ruby on Rails, it does establish a clear structure and set of conventions for organizing code and managing data.
*   **Performance:**  The framework prioritizes performance by:
    *   Minimizing HTTP requests (through asset bundling).
    *   Using server-side rendering (avoiding the overhead of client-side rendering).
    *   Providing built-in caching mechanisms.
    *   Selectively loading only the necessary code (via the custom autoloader).
*   **Control:** The developer has a high degree of control over the generated HTML and the application's behavior.

**3. Architectural Overview**

HeEPP's architecture is a blend of MVC (Model-View-Controller) principles and a custom component-based system. Here's a breakdown of the key components:

*   **`index.php`:** The entry point for all requests. It sets up the environment, includes the core framework files, and handles routing.
*   **`core` Directory:** Contains the core framework code.
    *   **`Heepp.php`:** The base class that most other classes extend. It provides core functionality like data access, session management, and environment variable handling.
    *   **`Controller.php`:** The base class for all controllers.
    *   **`Element.php`:** The base class for UI components (elements).
    *   **`Fragment.php`:** (Apparently a subclass of `Element`).
    *   **`Output.php`:** A singleton class for managing output (HTML, data, etc.).
    *   **`library.php`:** Manages the loading of JavaScript and CSS libraries.
    *   **`shortcuts.xml`:** Defines aliases for elements (e.g., `<image>` maps to `core\element\base\image`).
    *   **`element`:** Contains a hierarchy of element classes, organized by category (e.g., `base`, `ui`, `math`, `format`).
    *   **`mold`:**  Contains code generators for creating PHP classes (e.g., models, collections).
    *   **`system`:** Contains core system files:
        *   `api.php`: Handles API requests.
        *   `app.php`: Initializes application settings.
        *   `bootstrap.php`:  Handles autoloading, configuration, and initialization.
        *   `data.php`:  Provides a unified interface for accessing data (similar to a service locator).
        *   `env.php`:  Loads environment variables.
        *   `log.php`:  Handles logging.
        *   `render.php`:  Handles the final rendering of the output.
        *   `route.php`:  Handles routing.
        *   `serve.php`:  Handles serving different types of content (HTML, JSON, etc.).
        *   `config`: Configuration files.
        *   `handlers`:  Autoloader, exception handler, session handler.
        *   `helpers`:  Global helper functions.
        *   `traits`:  Reusable code blocks (traits).

*   **`projects` Directory (or similar):**  Contains project-specific code.  The structure mirrors the `core` directory to some extent:
    *   `controllers`:  Application-specific controllers.
    *   `elements`:  Project-specific UI elements (that can override core elements).
    *   `models`:  Model definitions (in XML format).
    *   `views`:  Templates (using the `.phtml` or `.pml` extension).
    *   `config`: Project-specific configuration.
    *   `routes`: Project-specific routes.
    *   `storage`, `uploads`, `assets`:  Directories for storing data, uploaded files, and static assets.
 *  **`cache` Directory:** Used by the framework for caching views and other assets.

**4. Key Features and Innovations (in detail)**

*   **XML-Based Model Definitions:** This is a distinguishing feature.  Instead of defining models as PHP classes (like most ORMs), HeEPP uses XML files.  The `core/extension/database/Model.php` class is responsible for parsing these XML files and interacting with the database.  The XML defines:
    *   `table`: The database table name.
    *   `columns`: The table columns and their aliases.
    *   `joins`: Relationships to other tables (similar to SQL JOINs).
    *   `datasets`: Pre-defined queries (similar to named scopes or query scopes in modern ORMs).  These allow you to define common queries (e.g., `active`, `byId`) and reuse them.
    *   `key`: primary key

    This approach has some advantages:
    *   **Declarative:** The model structure is defined in a declarative way, separate from the PHP code.
    *   **Centralized:** All information about a model (table structure, relationships, queries) is in one place.
    *   **Potentially Easier for Non-Programmers:**  XML *might* be easier for non-programmers to understand than PHP class definitions (though this is debatable).

    However, it also has drawbacks:
    *   **Less Flexible:**  XML is less flexible than PHP code for defining complex logic.
    *   **Unusual:**  This approach is very different from how most modern PHP applications interact with databases.
    *   **Potential for Errors:**  XML validation is less robust than the type checking and compile-time errors you get with PHP classes.

*   **Custom Templating (PML/PHTML):** This is one of HeEPP's most significant and, for its time, innovative features. The `.pml` and `.phtml` files are processed by `core/extension/ui/view.php`. Key features:
    *   **HTML-like Syntax:**  The templating language is very close to HTML, making it easy for developers familiar with HTML to learn.
    *   **Variable Interpolation:**  Variables are interpolated using the `${variable}` syntax.  This is similar to string interpolation in many languages.
    *   **Data Binding (`bind` attribute):**  The `bind` attribute allows you to bind a variable to the content of an element. This provides a basic form of data binding.
    *   **Conditional Logic (`<if>` tag):** The `<if>` tag (implemented in `core/element/statement/pmlif.php`) allows for conditional rendering of content. It supports various conditions like `isset`, `isnull`, `empty`, `equalto`, `notequalto`, `contains`, and even evaluating arbitrary PHP expressions.
    *   **Loops (`<repeat>` tag):** The `repeat` tag allows you to iterate over arrays and render content for each item. It's similar to `foreach` loops in PHP or directives like `v-for` in Vue.js.
    *   **Function Calls (`loadFunction` attribute):** This is a powerful feature that allows you to call PHP methods directly from within the template. The results of the function call can be used to populate data or generate HTML.
    *   **Custom Elements:** The most significant feature.  Any tag that isn't a standard HTML tag is treated as a custom element.  HeEPP searches for a corresponding PHP class (in the `core/element` or project's `elements` directory) and instantiates it. The attributes of the tag become properties of the element object.  The content within the tag becomes the `$child` property.  This allows for the creation of reusable UI components.
    * **Nested Tags:** Tags can be nested.
    *   **`import` Attribute:**  Allows you to include other view files within a template.
    * **`core-library`**:  This special tag is used to load JavaScript and CSS libraries, as defined in `libraries.xml`. This shows an early form of component-specific assets.

*   **Element-Based UI:** The `core/Element.php` class is fundamental. It provides:
    *   **Tag Generation:**  The `render()` method generates the HTML for the element, including attributes and child content.
    *   **Attribute Handling:** The `attr()`, `addAttr()`, `setAttr()`, and `removeAttr()` methods provide a way to manage HTML attributes.
    *   **Child Content:**  The `add()` method allows you to add child elements or text content.
    *   **Property Injection:** (Potentially risky) The `__set()` magic method allows you to set attributes as if they were properties of the object.  This could be vulnerable to property injection if not handled carefully.

*   **Data Handling (`$this->output->data`):**
    *   **Centralized Data Store:**  The `data` property of the `output` object (available as `$this->output->data` in controllers and elements) acts as a central store for data that needs to be passed to views.
    *   **Dot Notation Access:** You can use dot notation (e.g., `data.user.name`) to access nested data.
    *   **Session Persistence:**  The `Heepp` class automatically saves the contents of `$this->output->session` to the `$_SESSION['heepp']` variable.  This provides a convenient way to persist data across requests.
    *  **`setData`:** To add data.
    *  **`getData`:** To retrieve data.
    *  **`dataKeyExist`:** To check data.

*   **Helper Functions:** The `core/system/helpers` directory contains a collection of global helper functions for common tasks:
    *   `crypt.php`: Encryption/decryption.
    *   `css.php`: CSS manipulation (e.g., `colorDarken`).
    *   `datetime.php`: Date and time formatting.
    *   `general.php`:  General-purpose functions (e.g., `dd`, `pd`, `isClosure`, `array_var`, `urlExists`).
    *   `html.php`: HTML manipulation (e.g., `removeCSSAndScripts`, `convertToLinks`).
    *   `math.php`: Mathematical functions.
    *   `storage.php`: File system operations (e.g., `load`, `loadJSON`, `loadXML`, `urlToPath`, `pathToUrl`).
    *   `strings.php`: String manipulation (e.g., `strReplaceFirst`, `isJson`, `isHtml`, `slugify`).

*   **Event Handling (`core.event`):**  The `core.event` object in `core.js` provides a way to bind event handlers (like `click`) to elements.  The `core.event.click.load` function, in particular, demonstrates how to trigger AJAX requests on click events.

*   **AJAX Handling (`core/system/route.php` and `index.php`):**  The framework uses AJAX to load content dynamically. The `index.php` file handles routing, and the `ProjectLoader::loadController()` method is responsible for loading and executing the appropriate controller method. The results are typically returned as JSON and then used to update the DOM.

*   **Caching:** The framework includes basic caching mechanisms (file-based, Memcached, and session-based).

*   **Libraries:**  HeEPP includes a number of pre-bundled JavaScript libraries (jQuery, UIkit, Bootstrap, etc.) and provides a mechanism for loading them via the `core-library` element. The `libraries.xml` file defines the available libraries and their dependencies.

**5. Comparison to Modern Practices (Detailed)**

| Feature               | HeEPP Approach                                                                                                                                                                        | Modern Approach (e.g., Laravel, Symfony, React, Vue)                                                                                                            | Pros of HeEPP Approach (for its time)                     | Cons of HeEPP Approach (by modern standards)                                                                 |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Dependency Management** | Custom `libraries.xml` and `library.php` for front-end assets.  No standard package manager for PHP.                                                                              | Composer for PHP dependencies. npm, Yarn, or pnpm for JavaScript dependencies.                                                                             | Simpler setup (no need to learn Composer).                | Harder to update libraries.  No version control for dependencies. Potential for conflicts.                  |
| **Autoloading**      | Custom autoloader (`CoreLoader.php`, `ProjectLoader.php`).                                                                                                                          | PSR-4 autoloading (via Composer).                                                                                                                                    | More efficient (loads only necessary files).               | Potential security vulnerabilities if not carefully implemented.  Less standard, harder for new developers. |
| **Routing**           | Custom routing in `core/system/route.php` and `index.php`.  Uses query parameters (`?controller=...&params=...`) or routes defined in `routes.php`                                       | Dedicated routing component (e.g., Symfony's Routing, Laravel's Router).  Routes defined in configuration files, often using a more expressive syntax.            | Simpler to understand for basic routing.                  | Less flexible and powerful.  Harder to manage complex routes. Potential for URL manipulation vulnerabilities. |
| **Templating**        | Custom `.pml` and `.phtml` templating.  Server-side rendering.  HTML-like syntax with extensions for data binding, logic, and custom elements.                                        | Twig, Blade, Plates (PHP).  React, Vue, Angular (JavaScript).  Often use a virtual DOM for client-side rendering.                                                  | Easier for HTML developers to learn.  Better SEO.        | Less mature ecosystem.  Potentially less secure (manual escaping required).  Can lead to mixing of concerns.   |
| **Data Access**       | XML-based model definitions.  Custom `Model` class with methods for querying the database.  Likely uses direct SQL queries (with escaping).                                        | ORM (Doctrine, Eloquent) or query builder.  Database migrations.                                                                                                    | Simpler for basic CRUD operations.                       | More prone to SQL injection.  Harder to manage complex relationships.  Less maintainable for large projects.    |
| **Configuration**     | XML files for model definitions, shortcuts, and library definitions.  `app.*.php` files for application settings.  `.env` file for environment variables.                             | YAML, JSON, or PHP arrays for configuration.  `.env` files are standard.                                                                                            | XML provides some structure.                              | XML can be verbose.  Scattered configuration files can be harder to manage.                                    |
| **UI Components**    | "Elements" and "Fragments" (custom PHP classes).  Reusable UI components defined in PHP.                                                                                        | React, Vue, Angular components.  Typically defined using JavaScript (or TypeScript) and HTML-like templates.                                                       | Server-side rendering, so potentially faster initial load. | Less interactive.  Harder to build complex, dynamic UIs.                                                        |
| **State Management**  | Server-side state management using `$_SESSION`.  Data passed to views via `$this->output->data`.                                                                              | Client-side state management (Redux, Vuex, etc.) or server-side state management with tools like Livewire.                                                        | Simpler for many applications.  Avoids client-side overhead. | Less suitable for highly interactive applications.  Session management can be less secure if not done carefully. |
| **API Interaction**   | Direct API calls within templates (potentially).  Custom `RestClient` class.                                                                                                     | API calls typically handled in controllers or services, with data passed to views.  Dedicated HTTP client libraries (e.g., Guzzle, Axios).                          | Simpler for basic API interactions.                      | Blurs separation of concerns.  Can make templates harder to test and maintain.                                  |
| **Error Handling**     | Basic error handling with `throw new \Exception` and a custom exception handler.                                                                                                 | More robust error handling with detailed error messages, logging, and debugging tools.                                                                         | Simple.                                                   | Less informative error messages.  Harder to debug.                                                              |
| **Security**          | Relies on manual escaping and input validation (using `input()` helper and `escape_value()` in the `Database` class). Basic access control with `hasAccess()` and library authentication. | Built-in protection against common vulnerabilities (CSRF, XSS, SQL injection).  More comprehensive authentication and authorization systems.                     | Some awareness of security.                             | More vulnerable to common web attacks if not implemented very carefully.                                     |
| **Testing**           | No built-in testing framework.                                                                                                                                                   | PHPUnit for unit testing.  Various tools for integration and end-to-end testing.                                                                                 | N/A                                                       | Much harder to write automated tests.                                                                     |
| **Code Style**      | No adherence to modern PSR coding standards.                                                                                                                                    | PSR-1, PSR-2, PSR-12 are widely adopted.                                                                                                                            | N/A                                                       | Code can be harder to read and maintain.                                                                     |

**6. Security Considerations (Detailed):**

I've already touched on this, but it's worth reiterating the key security points:

*   **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  While the `input()` helper likely provides *some* level of protection, it's crucial to ensure that *all* user-provided data is properly validated and sanitized before being used in SQL queries, HTML output, or any other context where it could be exploited.  Modern frameworks provide dedicated validation libraries and automatic output escaping to mitigate these risks.
*   **SQL Injection:** The `Database` class uses `mysqli_real_escape_string()` (or a fallback if that's not available). This is *better* than nothing, but it's *not* as secure as using prepared statements with parameterized queries. Prepared statements are the gold standard for preventing SQL injection.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  HeEPP relies on manual escaping using `htmlspecialchars()` within the `Element::render()` method and potentially within custom elements. This is error-prone. Modern templating engines automatically escape output by default, reducing the risk of XSS.
*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):**  HeEPP doesn't appear to have built-in CSRF protection. This is a significant vulnerability.
*   **Session Management:**  Directly manipulating `$_SESSION` is risky.  A dedicated session management library (or PHP's built-in session handling with proper configuration) is recommended.
*   **`eval()`:**  The use of `eval()` in `core/element/math/calc.php` and potentially elsewhere is a major security risk and should be avoided.
* **Object injection**

**7. Modernization Potential:**

HeEPP could be modernized, but it would require significant effort.  Here's a potential roadmap:

1.  **Security Audit:**  A thorough security audit is the *highest* priority.  Identify and fix any potential vulnerabilities.
2.  **Composer and PSR-4:**  Migrate to Composer for dependency management and adopt PSR-4 autoloading.
3.  **Templating Engine:**  Integrate a modern templating engine (Twig, Blade, or Plates).  Consider creating custom extensions/directives to allow for the use of HeEPP "Elements" within the templates.
4.  **ORM/Query Builder:**  Replace the custom database interaction with an ORM (like Doctrine or Eloquent) or a query builder. This would improve security and maintainability.
5.  **Input Validation:**  Integrate a robust validation library (like Respect/Validation).
6.  **Routing:**  Replace the custom routing system with a more powerful and flexible routing component.
7.  **Dependency Injection:**  Introduce a dependency injection container to manage dependencies and improve testability.
8.  **Event System:**  Consider adding an event system for decoupling components.
9.  **Code Style:**  Refactor the code to adhere to PSR-1, PSR-2, or PSR-12 coding standards.
10. **Testing:**  Write unit tests (using PHPUnit) to ensure the framework's functionality and prevent regressions.
11. **Namespaces** Add namespaces to the rest of the framework.

**8. Lessons Learned:**

*   **Simplicity vs. Complexity:** HeEPP demonstrates that it's possible to build a functional web framework with a relatively small amount of code.  It's a reminder that not every project needs the full complexity of a large framework.
*   **The Value of Server-Side Rendering:** HeEPP's server-centric approach is a valid alternative to client-side rendering, and it's seeing a resurgence in popularity.
*   **Evolution of Web Development:** HeEPP provides a snapshot of web development practices in a specific era. It highlights how much things have changed in the past decade.
*   **"Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY):**  HeEPP's attempt to create reusable components ("Elements") and avoid code duplication is a good example of the DRY principle.
*   **"Convention over Configuration":** HeEPP has some conventions, but it's more flexible than frameworks like Rails. This is a trade-off; more flexibility can mean more complexity.
*   **Security is Paramount:**  Even if a framework is simple and efficient, it *must* be secure.  Modern frameworks prioritize security, and any modernization of HeEPP would need to do the same.

```
**Structure:**
The structure now resembles a framework structure, with clear separation of configuration (`config`), controllers, models, views, and even "molds" which seem to be code generation templates.  The `core` directory from the framework is implied to be a sibling to the `html` directory (as per the `.env` file).

**Observations & Analysis, incorporating the Project Code:**

*   **`html/.env`:** This file correctly sets the project name (`project.name`) and the path to the project, relative to the HeEPP core. This is good practice for configuration.

*   **`html/index.php`:**  This correctly bootstraps the application, pointing to the HeEPP core's `index.php` for the heavy lifting. It's a very simple entry point.

*   **`html/config`:**
    *   **`app.*.php` Files:** These files demonstrate a modular approach to configuration. Each file focuses on a specific aspect of the application (API, cache, database, email, etc.). This is much better than having one monolithic configuration file.  This is a good practice.  The `app.project.php` is particularly important, as it likely defines project-specific settings.
    *   **`database/*.php`:**  These files (likely) define database connection parameters.  The presence of `local.database.php` suggests an environment-specific configuration, which is also good practice.  The `Connection` class within these files is a simple database connection factory.

*   **`html/controllers`:**
    *   **`Controller.php`:**  This is a base controller class that extends `core\Controller`, providing common functionality to all project controllers. This is standard practice in MVC frameworks.
    *   **Specific Controllers (e.g., `Company.php`, `User.php`):** These controllers handle specific parts of the application logic.  They follow a naming convention (singular noun) that's common in MVC.
    *   **`controllers.xml`:** This file is unusual. It appears to define metadata about the controllers (alias, icon, status, authentication requirements, methods). This is a custom approach to managing controller information; a modern framework would likely use annotations or a dedicated routing configuration file.
    * **`tree.php`** Seems to be a controller that uses to map a folder structure to the framework. It could probably replace a XML with the functionality.

*   **`html/models`:**
    *   **XML Files:**  Each model is defined in an XML file. This specifies the database table, columns, relationships (joins), and pre-defined datasets (similar to named scopes in an ORM). This is a *very* unusual approach in modern PHP.
    * There is a `modelHistory.xml` file which would imply this is where all CRUD operations is logged

*   **`html/molds`:** This directory contains PHP code generation templates, likely used to create model, collection, and iterator classes. The `php` subdirectory suggests a focus on PHP code generation. The naming conventions (e.g., `companyCollection.php`, `CompanyItem.php`) are consistent.

*   **`html/routes`:** Contains route definitions. The `core.php` likely defines core framework routes, while `web.php` defines project-specific routes. This demonstrates a separation of routing concerns.

*   **`html/views`:** Contains view templates (likely `.pml` or `.phtml` files). The structure suggests an organization by controller and action (e.g., `views/fgx/company/viewCompanies.pml`).  The `partials` directory likely contains reusable view components.  The presence of `js` subdirectories within view directories suggests that JavaScript specific to a view might be placed there (a form of component-scoped JavaScript).

*   **`html/views/wiki`:** This appears to contain documentation or notes in Markdown format.

**Key Project-Specific Functionality:**

*   **`App` Controller:** A base controller for the application.
*   **`Company` Controller:** Handles company-related operations (CRUD, viewing locations, accounts, contacts).
*   **`Console` Controller:**  Likely related to the HeEPP console (an administrative interface).
*   **`User` Controller:**  Handles user management (login, profile, permissions).
*   **`Wiki` Controller:**  Probably serves the wiki pages.
* **`coreFO` and `$this->setOffcanvas`:**  These methods are used to generate and render UI, the view/template file is passed in and then the content is then set with $this->setHtml()

**Model Example (from `company.xml`):**

```xml
<database
    connection="heepp"
    name="company"
    alias="Companies"
    single="Company"
    many="Companies"
    public="false">
    <table
        name="companies"
        key="id">
        <columns>
            <company_name alias="Company Name"/>
            <vat_number   alias="VAT Number"/>
            <created_at   alias="Date and Time"/>
            <updated_at   alias="Date and Time Updated"/>
            <user_id      alias="User ID"/>
        </columns>
    </table>
</database>
```
This defines a model named "Company" that maps to the `companies` table. It specifies the primary key (`id`) and the columns. The `alias` attribute provides a human-readable name for each column.

**Controller Example (from `Company.php`):**

```php
<?php
use core\extension\database\Model;
use core\extension\ui\view;

class Company extends Controller {
    function getCompanies($status = 'active') {
        return (new Model('company'))->loadDataSet($status)->runDataSet()->results;
    }

    // ... other methods ...
}
```

This shows:

*   Extending the base `Controller` class.
*   Using the `Model` class to interact with the database.
*   The `loadDataSet()` method (likely part of the custom `Model` class) to load pre-defined queries from the XML model definition.
*   `runDataSet()` to execute the query.
*   `results` to access the results.

**Overall Project Assessment:**

The project code demonstrates a consistent implementation of the HeEPP framework's features.  It shows how controllers, models, views, and custom elements are used to build a web application. The code is relatively clean and easy to follow, given the framework's conventions. However, the tight coupling to the framework and the use of non-standard approaches (XML for models, custom templating) would make it challenging to migrate to a different framework or to integrate with modern PHP libraries.

The project structure and code suggest a well-organized application, albeit one built using a non-standard, custom framework. The developer clearly had a good understanding of MVC principles and how to structure a web application. The biggest challenges for maintaining this project would be the reliance on a custom framework (making it harder to find developers familiar with it) and the potential security concerns that need to be addressed through careful code review and updates.
