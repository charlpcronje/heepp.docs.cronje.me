# Learn you php


```sh
composer global require php-school/learn-you-php:~0.1

# This will install Learn You PHP! globally on your system. You should be able to run it by typing:

learnyouphp
```

First, we need a folder to contain our work, lets go for: `learnyouphp` in our home directory

```sh
cd ~
mkdir learnyouphp
cd learnyouphp
```

Open up a text editor and place the following code in there:

```php
<?php

  echo "Hello World";
```

Save this as a file named `helloworld-solution.php` in the folder we just created. Now we can jump back to the command line and verify our exercise:

```sh
learnyouphp verify helloworld-solution.php
```

You should receive a message describing your solution as a success.

So, you completed your first exercise â€“ you can now move on to the next exercise, each exercise increases in difficulty whilst introducing new concepts in PHP!
